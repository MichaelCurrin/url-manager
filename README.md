# URL Manager
>Centralise, view, edit, label and organise collections of your favorite URLs.

The aim is to help you create and find your URL more efficiently and within a personalised structure. The result is a tool for you to import browser bookmark-related URL data from various sources and manage them in a single structured, easy-to-search data source.

Import data from the following data sources:

- bookmark files
    * Firefox
    * Chrome
- history file
- OneTab data
- a CSV created by hand in the required format

You can also add and manage records with a command-line tool.
