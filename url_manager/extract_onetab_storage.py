    Parse LevelDB OneTab data from bytes to dict.

    The encoding of the bytes state data in the database is not UTF-8 or
    ASCII, so this function takes unreadable data and makes sense of it. This
    was done by inspection and experimenting until the result has a parsable
    JSON structure, clean URLs values and mostly clean titles (which can
    get overwritten later anyway by hand or reading fresh metadata from the
    site).

    The b"\x00" character is repeated throughout at every second character and
    shows as a box when printed. It could be a null character, but
    apparently the meaning of the character depends on the encoding so it could
    be anything. Dropping it mostly works well.

    When keeping it in during testing with `data.decode('ascii', errors=ignore)`
    meant that some important fields are garbled. When removing this character
    and not using `.decode`, the str representation looks much neater and is
    very useful. It has few symbols (punctuation, and emojis and escaped quotes)
    which need to be corrected.

    :param data_bytes: OneTab data as a bytes string, as retrieved from
        the Chrome LevelDB storage. This should be in a JSON format
        when viewed as a string.
